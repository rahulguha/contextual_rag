    "ai": "Based on the contextual information provided, the discussion does not directly address who can be claimed as significant others for tax purposes. The focus is more on the broader concept of significant others in our personal lives, beyond just romantic partners.\n\nHowever, I can provide some general information about who can be claimed as dependents or significant others for tax purposes:\n\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, the term \"significant other\" is not an official tax filing status. However, you may be able to claim certain individuals as dependents on your tax return, which can provide tax benefits.\n\nThe main categories of dependents that can be claimed include:\n\n- Qualifying child - A child (including adopted, step, or foster child) who meets certain age, relationship, residency, and support tests.\n\n- Qualifying relative - A person (related or unrelated) who meets tests for being your dependent based on their income, support received, and relationship to you.\n\n- Spouse - Your husband or wife if you are married.\n\nThe rules for claiming dependents can be complex, with specific criteria that must be met. Factors like the dependent's relationship to you, their income, and how much financial support you provide can all impact whether they qualify.\n\nI'd recommend consulting a tax professional or the IRS guidelines if you have specific questions about who you can claim as a dependent on your tax return. The contextual information provided does not directly address the tax-related aspects of significant others."
